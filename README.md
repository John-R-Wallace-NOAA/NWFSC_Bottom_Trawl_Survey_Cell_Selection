## Legacy R Code for NWFSC Bottom Trawl Survey Cell Selection

Change the folder path and year of survey as needed in the 'Select.Cells.Main.R' script and step through the code.


The [Distance Between Primary and Alternatives](https://github.com/John-R-Wallace-NOAA/NWFSC_Bottom_Trawl_Survey_Cell_Selection/blob/main/Distance%20Between%20Primary%20and%20Alternatives.png) figure shows the distance between the primary and 1st alternative in the top panel and the distance between the primary and the 2nd alternative in the bottom panel. This figure gives an idea of the randomness achieved in this code and for survey design consistence future code should approximately match this randomness.

See the NOAA tech memo, [The Northwest Fisheries Science Centerâ€™s West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey: History, Design, and Description](https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/assets/25/8655_02272017_093722_TechMemo136.pdf), for more information.
